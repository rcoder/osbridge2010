## My five stages of coping with the iPad ##

!SLIDE bullets incremental

# Denial #

* I don't even *want* an iPad. Really.

* Surely things will be different this time.

* Where are they still in stock in Portland?

# Anger #

* Section 3.3.1? Blasphemy! How can they treat us this way!!

* Also, screw you Amazon -- I didn't want a Kindle SDK invite, anyway.

# Bargaining #

* So Flash is a no-go...what about Mono? Lua? MacRuby? 
* Okay, I guess I can learn Objective-C. Core Animation is pretty cool after all...
* Kindle apps on other h/w are great, but missing:
** Whispersync
** cross-device support
** good markup

# Depression #

* Time to sell the iPad, toss my phone, and move to South America?

!SLIDE bullets incremental

# Acceptance #

* They're just devices. I can do this.
